#Anagram Checker

This project is a straightforward web application that determines if two words are anagrams. By taking user input, the app validates whether both fields are filled, converts the words to lowercase, sorts their letters, and compares the results. If the sorted letters match, the words are anagrams. The app also features a clear button to reset the input fields and the result message.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project helped me learn about DOM manipulation, event handling, string operations, and creating responsive designs.
